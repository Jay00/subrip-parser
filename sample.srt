00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,010
and he was like,

181
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:46,843
he callin his friends,

182
00:12:46,843 --> 00:12:48,750
and I'm like, "For what? We're females."

183
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,170
And him and her, him and
Kendall started arguing.

184
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,400
And like-

185
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,459
- [Braxton] Did the boyfriend
and Kendall start arguing?

186
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:56,292
- [K. Jones] Yeah.

187
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:58,446
- [Braxton] Okay, and what was said?

188
00:12:58,446 --> 00:12:59,279
- [K. Jones] He was like,

189
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,112
I don't even know,

190
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,430
'cause I've been going through a lot,

191
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,040
I have like a lot of disorders and stuff.

192
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,540
I black out and stuff.

193
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,373
- [Braxton] Mm hmm.

194
00:13:07,373 --> 00:13:08,206
- [K. Jones] So like, I don't remember

195
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:10,290
what happened right there.

196
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,180
I just know I heard,

197
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,177
and then she's like,

198
00:13:13,177 --> 00:13:14,010
"I think he shot me."

199
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,630
And we both tried to run,

200
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,810
and then I blacked out and she
was pushin us out the door-

201
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,079
- [Braxton] Who's the she?

202
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:20,912
- [K. Jones] Tamiyah.

203
00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:21,990
- [Braxton] Was pushing
you out of which room?

204
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,340
- [K. Jones] The door, the house door,

205
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,300
the front door.

206
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,340
And when I got down the...

207
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,717
I don't even know how
I got down the steps,

208
00:13:27,717 --> 00:13:29,730
but I seen Deshawna,

209
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,587
and I was like,

210
00:13:31,587 --> 00:13:32,570
'cause I seen red stuff on the floor,

211
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,670
so I'm thinking Kenzo
had went down the steps.

212
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,960
I'm like, "Where Kenzo?"

213
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,460
She like, "I thought she was with you."

214
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,810
And I'm like, "No."

215
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,400
So we tried to get back in the house,

216
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,840
but the door was locked,

217
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,673
and we was leaving out

218
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:48,673
and the police was
coming and they was like,

219
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,460
"We tried to get in, the door's locked."

220
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,977
So they had to kick the door in

221
00:13:51,977 --> 00:13:54,420
'cause they locked the door,

222
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,773
and then, that's it.

223
00:13:56,773 --> 00:13:57,606
- [Braxton] Okay.

224
00:13:57,606 --> 00:13:58,713
So let's back up.

225
00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:02,460
So you and Kenzo were going over there.

226
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,293
- [K. Jones] To get the stuff.

227
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:04,260
- [Braxton] To get the stuff.

228
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,280
How had y'all communicated
with her to let her know-

229
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,650
- [K. Jones] I got some of
my stuff on Thursday,

230
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,840
this Thursday that just passed,

231
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,070
and she was cool about it.

232
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,410
But when I got at the boyfriend,

233
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,840
when I came there that day I had a tote,

234
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,340
and I was getting it from her house,

235
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,840
she was cool about it and stuff.

236
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,120
We was talking about
taking the kids to Launch,

237
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,217
and the trampoline place and stuff.

238
00:14:25,217 --> 00:14:26,580
- [Braxton] So you got kids, too?

239
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,450
- [K. Jones] Yeah, I have a daughter.

240
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,705
- [Braxton] Okay.

241
00:14:28,705 --> 00:14:29,880
- [K. Jones] So, we was on some cool stuff.

242
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,878
It wasn't no like animosity or nothing.

243
00:14:31,878 --> 00:14:32,711
- [Braxton] Right.

244
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:33,990
- [K. Jones] And he brushed past me

245
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,090
and he went down the steps real fast

246
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,620
and got into a black car,

247
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,243
but I don't know him, so,

248
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,047
he always had animosity from Thursday

249
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,800
to the day when we just seen him,

250
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,540
he had animosity, but I don't know.

251
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,890
- [Braxton] Well, do
you know what his name is?

252
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,570
- [K. Jones] No, I never met him.

253
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,403
That's what I'm sayin.

254
00:14:49,403 --> 00:14:50,310
- [Braxton] When's the
first time you saw him?

255
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,481
'Cause you saw him on Thursday-

256
00:14:51,481 --> 00:14:52,760
- [K. Jones] Thursday, that was
the first time I saw him

257
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,593
on Thursday.

258
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,350
And then today is the
second time I saw him.

259
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,485
- [Braxton] Same dude you saw Thursday

260
00:14:56,485 --> 00:14:58,020
is the same dude you saw today.

261
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,890
Okay.

262
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,780
So when you went over on Thursday,

263
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,613
he was there Thursday?

264
00:15:01,613 --> 00:15:03,060
- [K. Jones] Yeah, and he was leaving,

265
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,900
he was leaving, though.

266
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,190
He brushed past the two

267
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,480
and went down the steps.

268
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,530
As I grabbed the two,

269
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,640
I was going down the steps

270
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,050
and he got in a black car.

271
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,790
But he wasn't driving.

272
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,623
- [Braxton] He wasn't driving?

273
00:15:12,623 --> 00:15:14,013
- [K. Jones] No, he got in the passenger.

274
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:14,867
- [Braxton] Okay.

275
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:15,700
So,

276
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,590
on Thursday everything was fine?

277
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,637
- [K. Jones] Yeah, it was cool.

278
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:21,660
- [Braxton] Did she know
y'all were coming over today?

279
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,800
- [K. Jones] Yes.
- [Braxton] Okay.

280
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,633
Had y'all,

281
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:24,466
how'd y'all communicate?

282
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,997
- [K. Jones] I told her, I was like...

283
00:15:25,997 --> 00:15:28,317
'Cause she had blocked us
on Instagram and stuff,

284
00:15:28,317 --> 00:15:29,437
and I called her bluff, and I was like,

285
00:15:29,437 --> 00:15:32,310
"I'm about to get the rest of my stuff."

286
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,658
Around on this side stuff-

287
00:15:33,658 --> 00:15:34,491
- [Braxton] Okay.

288
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:35,324
- [K. Jones] And she was like, "Okay."

289
00:15:35,324 --> 00:15:36,757
That's about when we was telling her,

290
00:15:36,757 --> 00:15:38,460
"We not on nothin."

291
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,293
And she was like all right,

292
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:40,743
but she was cool about it.

293
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,900
Well, we wasn't really arguing with her,

294
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,130
it was more so arguing with him

295
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,510
'cause he kept doing like this,

296
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,901
and I'm like,

297
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:47,734
- [Braxton] And that was today?

298
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:48,567
- [K. Jones] "We're females." Yes.

299
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:49,400
I'm like, "We're females.

300
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,233
What are you doin?"

301
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:51,690
And he was like, he calling his friends,

302
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,130
and I'm just like, "We're females."

303
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,590
That's why him and
Kendall started arguing,

304
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,423
and stuff.

305
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,676
And me and her, I don't even remember

306
00:15:58,676 --> 00:16:00,070
what was said.

307
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,890
- [Braxton] Well, did
you text her at all?

308
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:02,723
- [K. Jones] No.

309
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:04,110
- [Braxton] Did you send
her anything on Instagram?

310
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,582
- [K. Jones] No, she had
blocked us on Instagram.

311
00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:07,590
- [Braxton] You know
what her Instagram is?

312
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,423
- [K. Jones] Yeah.

313
00:16:08,423 --> 00:16:09,833
- [Braxton] What's
your Instagram, sweetie?

314
00:16:09,858 --> 00:16:11,058
- [K. Jones] K-E-N-

315
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,152
- [Braxton] K-E-N.

316
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:14,878
- [K. Jones] N-dot-underscore.

317
00:16:14,903 --> 00:16:16,402
- [Braxton] Dot-underscore.

318
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:17,160
- [K. Jones] Underscore.

319
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,343
- [Braxton] That's it?

320
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:20,615
- [K. Jones] Mhm. That's my Instagram.

321
00:16:23,491 --> 00:16:24,975
- [Braxton] And what about hers?

322
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,715
- [K. Jones] It's M-Y-Z-

323
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,192
- [Braxton] M-Y-

324
00:16:29,217 --> 00:16:30,965

325
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,529

326
00:16:31,554 --> 00:16:32,301

333
00:16:42,554 --> 00:16:43,741

334
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:44,533
- [K. Jones] That's it.

335
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:46,027
- [Braxton] That's it.

336
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,705
- [K. Jones] That's my phone, it's movin.

337
00:16:49,705 --> 00:16:50,674
- [Braxton] Okay.

338
00:16:50,674 --> 00:16:54,243
And that's Tamiyah's.

339
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,260
Have y'all been communicating at all

340
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,670
about anything else?

341
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,430
- [K. Jones] Yeah, we talked
about her daughter and stuff.

342
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,320
- [Braxton] Is that in text or IG?

343
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,453
- [K. Jones] No, like on the phone.

344
00:17:08,453 --> 00:17:09,417
- [Braxton] Okay.

345
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:10,380
- [K. Jones] And what she was saying

346
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,760
about the Launch and stuff,

347
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,667
and she was like,

348
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,700
"Yeah, I've been trying to get in contact

349
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,020
with her father and stuff."

350
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,950
- [Braxton] Whose father?

351
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,104
- [K. Jones] The baby's.

352
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,041
- [Braxton] Okay.

353
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,040
- [K. Jones] And she was
like, "She gone right now."

354
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,240
And stuff, that's what I'm sayin,

355
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,430
it was no animosity, it was no beef

356
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,870
for this to occur.

357
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:25,703
- [Braxton] Well, answer this,

358
00:17:25,703 --> 00:17:27,000
when y'all got over there today,

359
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,520
was anybody talking about
money, about something?

360
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,363
- [K. Jones] Yeah, 'cause,

361
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:33,660
okay so when we left our
stuff in the house, right,

362
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,010
she said she was movin

363
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,090
so she was gonna let us know

364
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,590
when to come get our stuff.

365
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,967
But it was like liquor
and stuff, and I was like,

366
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:42,810
"You know, if you don't have
the liquor and the stuff,

367
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:43,643
just give me the money for it."

368
00:17:43,643 --> 00:17:45,570
She was like, "I don't have no money."

369
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,710
- [Braxton] Right.

370
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,543
- [K. Jones] Yeah.
- [Braxton] Okay.

371
00:17:47,543 --> 00:17:49,230
So how did y'all get in the house?

372
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,160
- [K. Jones] She moved back.

373
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,360
At first she was like this,

374
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,500
and we put our foot right there,

375
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,030
but she had moved back and let us in

376
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,640
when I told her we wasn't
trying to do nothing to her.

377
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,473
- [Braxton] Right.

378
00:17:57,473 --> 00:17:59,727
- [K. Jones] 'Cause I was like, "You know me,

379
00:17:59,727 --> 00:18:00,600
we just comin to get this stuff."

380
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,720
And then we just got into
it with the boyfriend.

381
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,250
- [Braxton] So, when you say

382
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,900
we got into it with your boyfriend,

383
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,340
was your cousin upstairs with y'all?

384
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,930
Was it just you?

385
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,160
- [K. Jones] I think she was, yeah.

386
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,030
- [Braxton] Okay.

387
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,500
So, whose foot was in the door?

388
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,270
Was it yours or your girl's?

389
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,600
- [K. Jones] It was mine's.

390
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,720
All I remember is my foot,

391
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,071
and I think my cousin's.

392
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:20,904
- [Braxton] Okay.

393
00:18:20,904 --> 00:18:21,737
- [K. Jones] I'm not sure.

394
00:18:21,737 --> 00:18:23,940
- [Braxton] So, when y'all go inside.

395
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,800
- [K. Jones] We were standin
in the living room-

396
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,340
- [Braxton] In the living room.

397
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,110
Where else do y'all go at in the house

398
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,943
other than the living room?

399
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:30,630
- [K. Jones] When I was
still talking to Tamiyah

400
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,710
in the living room,

401
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,050
the boyfriend and Kenzo walked,

402
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,360
I don't know who walked back there first,

403
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,490
but they were both back there.

404
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,690
- [Braxton] You say back there?

405
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,523
- [K. Jones] Yeah, in her room,

406
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:43,366
'cause her house set up is,

407
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:44,891
when you open the front
door it's the living room.

408
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:45,724
[Braxton] Uh-huh.

409
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,400
- [K. Jones] And then this side is the kitchen

410
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,890
and is a room right there in the bathroom

411
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:50,723
straight across.

412
00:18:50,723 --> 00:18:53,010
And you could go straight
to the room, and-

413
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,300
- [Braxton] So straight to the bedroom.

414
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,133
- [K. Jones] Mm hmm.

415
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:55,966
Through the kitchen.

416
00:18:55,966 --> 00:18:56,799
- [Braxton] Through the kitchen.

417
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,890
So, were they in the kitchen?

418
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,860
- [K. Jones] Kenzo was in
the door of the kitchen,

419
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,740
and because the kitchen
leads into her bedroom-

420
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,967
- [Braxton] I got you.

421
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:08,220
- [K. Jones] And I didn't see him right there,

422
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,870
but he was inside the room.

423
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,430
- [Braxton] Okay,
and you could see that?

424
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,455
- [K. Jones] Yeah.

425
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:13,288
- [Braxton] Okay.

426
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:14,121
So,

427
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,140
when he's back there with Kenzo.

428
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,390
- [K. Jones] I just said, she
kept saying, "We're females."

429
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,260
They were arguing about,

430
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,060
'cause I guess he kept
reaching for his gun,

431
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,893
she was saying,

432
00:19:24,893 --> 00:19:25,950
"We're females, we not here to do nothing,

433
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,870
we just coming to get the stuff."

434
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:28,703
'Cause we know,

435
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,533
well, Thursday,

436
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:33,390
if it was an issue or
something, how he rubbed me off,

437
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,160
we would've brought males with us,

438
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,993
that's what I'm sayin,

439
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:38,160
we just came to get the stuff real quick

440
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,260
while we on this side.

441
00:19:40,952 --> 00:19:41,785
And that's what I'm sayin,

442
00:19:41,785 --> 00:19:43,410
if I knew who he was,

443
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,900
I would know where the
secret motive is coming from.

444
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,250
But I don't know him at all-

445
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,090
- [Braxton] Right.

446
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,700
- [K. Jones] I don't have no idea who he is.

447
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,533
- [Braxton] Okay.

448
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:52,890
But this is just the
second time you saw him?

449
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,723
- [K. Jones] Yeah.

450
00:19:53,723 --> 00:19:55,410
- [Braxton] Would you
recognize if you saw him?

451
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,929
- [K. Jones] I think I would, yeah.

452
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:57,762
- [Braxton] Okay.

453
00:19:57,762 --> 00:19:59,730
Have you ever seen any
pictures with her with him?

454
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,085
- [K. Jones] Yeah, a video.

455
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:01,918
- [Braxton] You do?

456
00:20:01,918 --> 00:20:03,346
- [K. Jones] Yeah, one of my
other friends sent it to me.

457
00:20:03,346 --> 00:20:04,830
they was like, "Ooh, is
this her new boyfriend?"

458
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,840
I was like, "Girl, I guess."

459
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,280
- [Braxton] Do you have that video?

460
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,630
- [K. Jones] Yeah, I can check.

461
00:20:40,553 --> 00:20:42,935
(phone vibrates)

462
00:20:42,935 --> 00:20:43,935
There it is.

463
00:20:46,402 --> 00:20:47,235
That video right there, you can click it.

464
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:53,043
This one.

465
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,873
- [Braxton] Y'all with these fancy new smartphones.

466
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,480
Right here?

467
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,470
This the video you talking about?

468
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,303
- [K. Jones] Yeah.

469
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,136
- [Braxton] And that, who's that?

470
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,867
- [K. Jones] That's the girl Tamiyah.

471
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:11,442
(indistinct audio)

472
00:21:15,297 --> 00:21:17,670
- [Braxton] Can you send me that?

473
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,503
So is this...

474
00:21:18,503 --> 00:21:20,070
You sayin, the boy?

475
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,420
- [K. Jones] Yeah, this him in the back.

476
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,350
- [Braxton] That's him in the back?

477
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,183
- [K. Jones] Mm hmm.

478
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:24,413
- [Braxton] Can you send me that?

479
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,802
- [K. Jones] What was your number?

480
00:21:38,802 --> 00:21:42,133
- [Braxton] 2-0-2-4-8-6

481
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:43,083
3-4-1-8.

482
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,563
- [K. Jones] Hold on,

483
00:21:48,563 --> 00:21:50,370
wait a second.

484
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,636
You said.

485
00:21:51,636 --> 00:21:54,660
- [Braxton] 2-0-2

486
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,493
4-8-6

487
00:21:57,123 --> 00:21:57,963
3-4-1-8.

488
00:22:13,414 --> 00:22:16,830
(Kenn comments indistinct)

489
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,820
Did you send it to me that time?

490
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,230
- [K. Jones] Mm hmm.
- [Braxton] Oh, okay.

491
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,600
So that's the boy that you saw today?

492
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,433
- [K. Jones] Yeah.

493
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:23,610
- [Braxton] And that's the same boy

494
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,310
you saying you saw on Thursday,

495
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,900
and that's the boy that you...

496
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,561
You saw reaching, like he
had something you said?

497
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:31,860
- [K. Jones] Yeah, it's in the video.

498
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,810
- [Braxton] Okay, in which video?

499
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,392
- [K. Jones] That the detectives got.

500
00:22:35,392 --> 00:22:36,420
- [Braxton] Okay.

501
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,253
How do you know that?

502
00:22:37,253 --> 00:22:38,647
- [K. Jones] 'Cause like
my dad always told me,

503
00:22:38,647 --> 00:22:40,980
"Whenever it's a male,

504
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,720
you always record."

505
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,710
- [Braxton] Oh, so you recorded today?

506
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,543
- [K. Jones] Mm hmm.

507
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,803
- [Braxton] Your dad
sound like a smart man.

508
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,660
- [K. Jones] Yes.

509
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,493
He is.

510
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,760
The detectives was

511
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,600
on pause in there, and stuff.

512
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,547
So it's gonna be like.

513
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,420
- [Braxton] So, when this is going on,

514
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,620
are you inside?

515
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,300
- [K. Jones] Yeah, we were in
the house talkin to her.

516
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,560
- [Braxton] Okay.

517
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,800
- [K. Jones] And he was arguing.

518
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,290
Well, she was saying...

519
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,513
They were arguin, him and Kendall.

520
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,270
And that's when I say he walked,

521
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,103
they walked to the back,

522
00:23:34,103 --> 00:23:36,270
I don't know who walked back there first,

523
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,250
'cause I was looking at her.

524
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,210
- [Braxton] Okay.

525
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,260
Can you send me that?

526
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,730
- [K. Jones] It's 3-4-1-8?

527
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,057
- [Braxton] Yeah, 3-4-1-8,

528
00:24:01,057 --> 00:24:04,390
4-8-6-3-4-1-8.

529
00:24:07,258 --> 00:24:09,330
(chair moving)

530
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,163
So,

531
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,190
where were you at?

532
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,290
So when all that happens, you're saying...

533
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,750
You said when y'all in
the apartment, right,

534
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,150
and they're getting into it,

535
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,410
and she talking about,

536
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,840
"Why you gotta do that, we're girls, we're girls."

537
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,863
And he's reachin,

538
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,143
you were in the living room at that point?

539
00:24:29,143 --> 00:24:31,470
- [K. Jones] Mm hmm.
- [Braxton] Okay.

540
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,730
Your girlfriend, Kendall,

541
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,290
she's still inside the apartment?

542
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,180
- [K. Jones] Yeah, we were
still in the apartment.

543
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,880
- [Braxton] So how do
you all end up outside

544
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,680
and she stays inside?

545
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,020
- [K. Jones] Because remember I told you,

546
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,100
when I heard the shot and stuff,

547
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,600
I don't know how I got down the stairs,

548
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,830
I be blacking out,

549
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,900
but I was down the steps
and I seen red stuff,

550
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,100
so in my head I'm thinking

551
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,600
Kendall left out the apartment.

552
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,980
- [Braxton] So you thought
she left out when you left out?

553
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,240
- [K. Jones] Yeah.

554
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,580
- [Braxton] So you said when
you got out the apartment,

555
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,690
you tried to get back in.

556
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,523
- [K. Jones] Yeah.

557
00:24:58,523 --> 00:25:01,500
'Cause when I asked Deshawna, I was like,

558
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,333
I said, "Where Kendall?"

559
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,166
She said, "She not with you?"

560
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,080
I was like, "No."

561
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,520
So we were coming back up the steps

562
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,660
and we were trying to open the door,

563
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,493
but it was locked,

564
00:25:07,493 --> 00:25:09,120
and we started to hear the sirens

565
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,799
so we went back downstairs.

566
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:11,632
- [Braxton] Okay.

567
00:25:11,632 --> 00:25:14,220
Did you yell for anybody
or anything like that?

568
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,540
- [K. Jones] No, we called the police.

569
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,380
- [Braxton] Y'all called the police?

570
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,700
- [K. Jones] Mm hmm.
- [Braxton] Okay.

571
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,700
So, did your girlfriend Tamiyah,

572
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,353
what's her name?

573
00:25:24,353 --> 00:25:25,186
- [K. Jones] Tamiyah.

574
00:25:25,186 --> 00:25:26,019
- [Braxton] Did she come out?

575
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:28,050
- [K. Jones] What they did was,
they locked the front door,

576
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,580
then they left out the back door

577
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,413
and locked that door, too.

578
00:25:30,413 --> 00:25:31,470
- [Braxton] How do you
know they left out the back?

579
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,482
- [K. Jones] Because they
were not in the apartment.

580
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:34,315
- [Braxton] They
weren't in the apartment?

581
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:35,148
- [K. Jones] No.
- [Braxton] Okay.

582
00:25:35,148 --> 00:25:35,981
- [K. Jones] And they didn't
come out the front door

583
00:25:35,981 --> 00:25:37,590
because we were still at
the front tryin to get in.

584
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,350
- [Braxton] So the boy that
you showed me in that picture,

585
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,300
that's the same boy you saw on Thursday?

586
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,133
- [K. Jones] Yes.

587
00:25:43,133 --> 00:25:44,940
- [Braxton] That's the
same boy that you videotaped

588
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,290
when the stuff started today?

589
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,123
- [K. Jones] Yes.

590
00:25:47,123 --> 00:25:48,420
- [Braxton] And that's the same boy

591
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,340
that when you say he was walking,

592
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,170
reaching, and your girlfriend

593
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,160
Kendall was talking to him?

594
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,450
That's the same boy?
- [K. Jones] Yes.

595
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,950
- [Braxton] Okay, you just
don't know what his name is?

596
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,780
- [K. Jones] No.
- [Braxton] Okay.

597
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,450
And you said that's supposed
to be her boyfriend?

598
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,546
- [K. Jones] Her boyfriend, yeah.

599
00:26:02,546 --> 00:26:04,470
- [Braxton] And she never
posted what his name is,

600
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,303
or anything like that?

601
00:26:05,303 --> 00:26:07,057
- [K. Jones] No, when I asked her, I was like,

602
00:26:07,057 --> 00:26:07,890
"Who is that?"

603
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,870
She was like, "He not from nowhere."

604
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,293
And I was like, "Yeah, what's his name?"

605
00:26:12,293 --> 00:26:13,320
She wasn't tellin me,

606
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,640
she was bein discreet.

607
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,840
- [Braxton] Being real discreet?

608
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,120
So, your friend that sent you

609
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,770
the page thing about him,

610
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,870
does she know anything about this dude?

611
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,933
- [K. Jones] No, nobody know
of him, that we be with.

612
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,470
- [Braxton] How long
have you known Kendall?

613
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,810
- [K. Jones] I met her in December,

614
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,850
we really started hanging in January.

615
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,380
- [Braxton] How long
have you known Tamiyah?

616
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,060
- [K. Jones] I knew Jim...

617
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,797
I knew Tamiyah since December, as well.

618
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:39,381
- [Braxton] Since December?

619
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:40,950
So, are you close?

620
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,950
Did you meet them together, or separate?

621
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,420
- [K. Jones] I've been knew Kendall,

622
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,910
we just never really hung out,

623
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:51,060
but we all started to
hang together in January.

624
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,010
- [Braxton] Okay.

625
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:58,680
And you just don't know what happened

626
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,660
to cause this to happen like that?

627
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,493
Nobody,

628
00:27:01,493 --> 00:27:02,820
you didn't have a weapon?

629
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,650
- [K. Jones] No, I got mace on my key chain,

630
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,110
but I didn't attempt to use it.

631
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,700
So, I don't know.

632
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,590
- [Braxton] So when
you heard the gunshot,

633
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,210
where were you at?

634
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,960
- [K. Jones] I was standing beside her.

635
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:15,683
Not beside her,

636
00:27:15,683 --> 00:27:17,537
but adjacent, from her at an angle.

637
00:27:17,537 --> 00:27:18,690
- [Braxton] Right, and you said

638
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,890
you heard her say something about-

639
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,987
- [K. Jones] She said, "I think I got shot."

640
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:23,237
'Cause I didn't know
which one of us got shot.

641
00:27:23,237 --> 00:27:25,110
- [Braxton] Right.
- [K. Jones] I just heard it,

642
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,090
I didn't even know anybody got shot,

643
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,140
she was like this,

644
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,220
we were both trying to run.

645
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,720
She was like, "I think I got shot."

646
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,130
- [Braxton] And she said
that to you, "I think"-

647
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:32,963
- [K. Jones] Yeah, and we were running

648
00:27:32,963 --> 00:27:34,230
then, I don't know,

649
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,640
my vision went out.

650
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,533
- [Braxton] Okay.

651
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,173
So,

652
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,810
where do you think your
girlfriend would go

653
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,703
if something like this happened?

654
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,590
- [K. Jones] I would say to her mom house,

655
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,180
but I don't think she would go there.

656
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,013
- [Braxton] Does she have-

657
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:53,398
- [K. Jones] 'Cause she got four kids,

658
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:54,570
so it is not like she can't go,

659
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,770
you feel what I'm sayin?
- [Braxton] Right.

660
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,630
- [K. Jones] She don't have
nowhere else to go.

661
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,890
- [Braxton] Well, how
many kids were there today

662
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,723
when you got there?

663
00:27:59,723 --> 00:28:01,320
- [K. Jones] One.
- [Braxton] Just one.

664
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,150
Do you know where her other kids were at?

665
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,590
- [K. Jones] No.
- [Braxton] Okay.

666
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,330
So, she have a car?

667
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,170
- [K. Jones] No.

668
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,250
- [Braxton] You don't
know if he has a car

669
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,240
'cause you saw him getting a car-

670
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,073
- [K. Jones] In the passenger-

671
00:28:10,073 --> 00:28:11,091
- [Braxton] Passenger's seat.

672
00:28:11,091 --> 00:28:15,660
- [K. Jones] Yeah.

673
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,100
- [Braxton] And he was
wearing the same stuff

674
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,979
you saw in the video that you showed me?

675
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:19,812
- [K. Jones] Yeah, today,

676
00:28:19,812 --> 00:28:20,645
that was the video today.

677
00:28:20,645 --> 00:28:22,228
- [Braxton] Okay.

678
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:26,820
Did you see the gun?

679
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,870
- [K. Jones] I seen,

680
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,390
no, when he shot I didn't see the gun,

681
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,390
but he had something right here,

682
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,177
but I can't remember,

683
00:28:36,177 --> 00:28:39,360
my memory is, got holes
in it or something.

684
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,613
- [Braxton] I can understand.

685
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:44,010
Did he say anything to y'all?

686
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,360
Did you remember before he-

687
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,720
- When he was shooting he
said, "I just came home."

688
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,540
- [Braxton] That's what
he said, "I just came home"?

689
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,707
- [K. Jones] Yeah.

690
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,260
Yeah he did.

691
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,093
- [Braxton] And that's all he said,

692
00:28:56,093 --> 00:28:57,150
"I just came home."

693
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,386
And what did you take that to mean?

694
00:28:59,386 --> 00:29:01,200
- [K. Jones] At the moment,

695
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,640
I didn't think nothing of it

696
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,047
until when I was talking to
the detective and she was like,

697
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:06,057
"Think back."

698
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,600
And I remember Tamiyah bein on the phone

699
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,470
with people in jail,

700
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,558
but I don't remember their names.

701
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:14,183
- [Braxton] Okay.

702
00:29:14,183 --> 00:29:16,530
So when you heard the
term, "I just came home."

703
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,060
What did you take that to mean?

704
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,830
- [K. Jones] Like, he wouldn't
do anything like that,

705
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,300
you just came home.

706
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,548
- [Braxton] Just came home from-

707
00:29:22,548 --> 00:29:24,383
- [K. Jones] Yeah, from jail.
- [Braxton] From jail, okay.

708
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:26,850
So your cousin,

709
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,350
was she inside when it happened?

710
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,310
- [K. Jones] I don't remember.

711
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,143
- [Braxton] You don't remember?

712
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,373
- [K. Jones] No.
- [Braxton] Okay.

713
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,960
And your cousin's the other young lady

714
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,880
that's sitting out there, okay.

715
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,270
Do you have any kind of communication,

716
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,560
do you mind showing me the last...

717
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,210
Your text message, so
I can see the last time

718
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,680
y'all communicated with each other.

719
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,513
- [K. Jones] Who?

720
00:29:44,513 --> 00:29:45,346
- [Braxton] You and Tamiyah?

721
00:29:45,346 --> 00:29:47,421
- I deleted everything
when she blocked me.

722
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:48,254
- [Braxton] Oh you did-

723
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:49,260
- [K. Jones] So I had to
call from block, here.

724
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,970
- [Braxton] Okay.

725
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,020
So you don't have nothing else

726
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,310
on your phone from her?

727
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,143
- [K. Jones] No.

728
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,273
- [Braxton] Okay.

729
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,370
- [K. Jones] I mean,

730
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,383
I think Kenzo texted her today.

731
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,805
- [Braxton] Kenzo did?

732
00:30:03,805 --> 00:30:05,199
- [K. Jones] Yeah, but I don't know her phone,

733
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:06,420
one of the detectives got it.

734
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,700
- [Braxton] One of her
phones, the detective has?

735
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,071
And you know, Kenzo texted
her today, you said.

736
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:13,308
- [K. Jones] Yeah, and she called her as well.

737
00:30:13,308 --> 00:30:14,580
- [Braxton] Right, and she called her.

738
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,900
So she didn't block Kenzo,

739
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,961
she just blocked you?

740
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:18,489
- [K. Jones] No.
(phone vibrating)

741
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:19,399
- [Braxton] Okay.

742
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:20,463
- [K. Jones] I don't know who that is.

743
00:30:22,917 --> 00:30:24,480
- [Braxton] And the
detective has her phone.

744
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,313
- [K. Jones] Mm hmm.

745
00:30:25,313 --> 00:30:26,146
- [Braxton] And how do you know

746
00:30:26,146 --> 00:30:26,979
the detective has her phone?

747
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:29,474
- [K. Jones] Because her cousin
was trying to get the phone

748
00:30:29,474 --> 00:30:31,230
and he was like, "No, we gotta keep this."

749
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,586
And he gave it to her.

750
00:30:32,586 --> 00:30:34,169
- [Braxton] Okay.

751
00:30:36,717 --> 00:30:38,280
And you knew that there was some kind

752
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,923
of text messages in there between her and-

753
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,959
- [K. Jones] Kenzo.
- [Braxton] Kenzo.

754
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,360
Between Tamiyah and Kenzo.

755
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,920
So she told her y'all were coming over

756
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,893
to get your stuff?

757
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:48,726
- [K. Jones] Yeah, she said okay.

758
00:30:48,726 --> 00:30:49,559
Maybe,

759
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:50,392
like in my head,

760
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:52,680
I'm thinking maybe the guy
wasn't there at the time,

761
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,410
he just got there when
we probably got there.

762
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,670
I don't know.

763
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,600
'Cause I don't know him

764
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,350
so I don't know his motive of anger or...

765
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,813
I don't know.

766
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:14,970
This shit just raise my blood pressure.

767
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,621
- [Braxton] Does Kendall have any kids?

768
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:17,454
- [K. Jones] No.

769
00:31:17,454 --> 00:31:19,037
- [Braxton] Okay.

770
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,216
How long did y'all live with Tamiyah?

771
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,130
- [K. Jones] We didn't
necessarily live with her.

772
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,160
- [Braxton] Stay over,

773
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,993
how long did y'all stay over at?

774
00:31:27,993 --> 00:31:29,043
- [K. Jones] We had been there for months,

775
00:31:29,043 --> 00:31:31,683
we'd go home, come back,
and stuff like that.

776
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,670
- [Braxton] Hmm.

777
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,377
And other than the dude saying,

778
00:31:44,377 --> 00:31:45,450
"I just came home."

779
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,190
There was nothing else that
you can remember being said,

780
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,907
other than your girl saying,

781
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,147
"Hey, we females, we females."

782
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,118
- [K. Jones] No.

783
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,604
- [Braxton] So after you heard the shot,

784
00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:03,540
you came out in the hall,

785
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,190
you got out the apartment?

786
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,770
- [K. Jones] No, we both did like this,

787
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,600
to make sure our face and stuff.

788
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,060
- Right, and she said-

789
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,000
- [K. Jones] She said, "I think I got shot."

790
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,050
And we both were running,

791
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:17,130
but I blacked out, so I don't remember.

792
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,080
- [Braxton] Okay.

793
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,530
How many gunshots did you hear?

794
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,970
- [K. Jones] I really don't remember.

795
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:24,833
- [Braxton] Okay.

796
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,510
But she said, "I think I got hit."

797
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,860
And then when you got out in the hallway,

798
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,397
you realized when you talked
to your cousin, it's like,

799
00:32:30,397 --> 00:32:31,980
"Where's she at? She's not with us."

800
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,630
- [K. Jones] Yeah, because
I thought I seen blood.

801
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,100
I just seen something red though

802
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,570
so I thought it was blood.

803
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,407
So I'm thinking she
down there and I'm like,

804
00:32:38,407 --> 00:32:39,546
"Where Kenzo at?"

805
00:32:39,546 --> 00:32:40,440
She was like, I" thought
she was with you."

806
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,400
And I'm like, "No."

807
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,960
So we went back to the apartment

808
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,793
trying to open the door,

809
00:32:43,793 --> 00:32:44,626
but it was locked.

810
00:32:44,626 --> 00:32:45,660
- [Braxton] You said it was locked.

811
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,552
- [K. Jones] Mm hmm.

812
00:32:46,552 --> 00:32:48,146
- [Braxton] And you know,
they never came out the front.

813
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:49,883
- [K. Jones] Yeah, 'cause
we were at the front.

814
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,720
I didn't think she got shot,

815
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,490
it hit her because I was close,

816
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:02,310
so I was thinking like blood
would be on me or something,

817
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,440
but I didn't see nothin.

818
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,023
- [Braxton] Okay.

819
00:33:14,544 --> 00:33:17,160
(objects fumbling)

820
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,060
You work, sweetie?

821
00:33:18,085 --> 00:33:19,129
- [Kenn K] Nuh-uh.

822
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,263
Yeah, you really are,

823
00:33:24,263 --> 00:33:25,560
you just turned 21.

824
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,843
- [K. Jones] Yeah.
(detective chuckles)

825
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,678
- [Braxton] And who do
you live with you now?

826
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:36,178
- [K. Jones] I live with my grandmother.

827
00:33:36,203 --> 00:33:38,201
- [Braxton] And that's who live at 52 53rd Street?

828
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:39,357
- [K. Jones] No, my mom.

829
00:33:39,382 --> 00:33:41,536
- [K. Jones] Well, I live, like-- I live with both, so.

830
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,435
Like, I would say.

831
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,138
- [Braxton] Okay. So they both live at that address?

832
00:33:44,163 --> 00:33:46,929
- [K. Jones] No, my grandmama lives on 4824 B Street.

833
00:33:46,954 --> 00:33:48,234
- [Braxton] 48-

834
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,218
- [K. Jones] 24.

835
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:49,765
- [Braxton] Mhm.

836
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,929
- [K. Jones] B Street.

837
00:33:50,954 --> 00:33:52,210
- [Braxton] B, or-
- [K. Jones] As in ball.

838
00:33:52,242 --> 00:33:54,187
- [K. Jones] Street Southeast.

839
00:33:54,212 --> 00:33:55,249
- [Braxton] I know where that's at.

840
00:34:00,176 --> 00:34:02,129
- [Braxton] She live on the house side or the apartment side?

841
00:34:02,154 --> 00:34:03,058
- [K. Jones] The house.

842
00:34:03,995 --> 00:34:05,433
- [Braxton] And what's your grandmother's name?

843
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:06,411
- [K. Jones] Diane.

844
00:34:06,436 --> 00:34:07,255
- [Braxton] Mhm.

845
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,559
- [K. Jones] Jenkins.

846
00:34:14,767 --> 00:34:16,494
- [Braxton] And you got a phone number for Grandma?

847
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:17,461
- [K. Jones] 2-0-2-

848
00:34:17,486 --> 00:34:19,791
7-9-3-

849
00:34:19,816 --> 00:34:21,923
9-1-9-4.

850
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,010
- [Braxton] So seeing how you said

851
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:39,753
everything was pretty much blank,

852
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,810
you said some things
you just can't remember,

853
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,730
like when she got
outside, stuff like that?

854
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:45,660
- [K. Jones] Mm hmm.

855
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,680
- [Braxton] But you know for sure

856
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,423
that's the same boy in the picture...

857
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:51,490
The video that you showed
me and stuff like that?

858
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,340
- [K. Jones] Yeah.
- [Braxton] Okay.

859
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,130
And he didn't say nothin else, after-

860
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,293
- [K. Jones] If he did, I can't
remember what he said.

861
00:34:58,293 --> 00:34:59,126
- [Braxton] Well, after the gunshot,

862
00:34:59,126 --> 00:35:01,170
what did your girlfriend Tamiyah say?

863
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,120
- [K. Jones] I didn't even see her no more,

864
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,550
I don't even remember.

865
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,300
I don't know how I got from

866
00:35:07,325 --> 00:35:08,277
the door downstairs.

867
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:09,637
Like, I don't.

868
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:12,923
- [Braxton] Okay.

869
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,750
Now your cousin that's out there,

870
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,370
is that your blood cousin?

871
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,473
- [K. Jones] Yeah, by marriage.

872
00:35:18,473 --> 00:35:19,773
- [Braxton] By marriage?

873
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:20,615
- [K. Jones] Mhm.

874
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,473
- [Braxton] You married?

875
00:35:21,473 --> 00:35:22,306
- [K. Jones] No.

876
00:35:22,306 --> 00:35:23,139
- [Braxton] Okay.

877
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:24,251
- [K. Jones] My mom.

878
00:35:24,251 --> 00:35:25,084
Your mom, okay.

879
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,203
What's her name?

880
00:35:27,228 --> 00:35:28,567
- [K. Jones] Deshawna.

881
00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:30,996
- [Braxton] Deshawna? D-E or D-A?

882
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:31,934
- [K. Jones] I'm not sure.

883
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:34,438
- [Braxton] Okay, I'll get it from her when I talk to her.

884
00:35:34,438 --> 00:35:35,271
All right, sweetie,

885
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:36,680
is there anything else
you can think about?

886
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,940
Do you remember what the boy was wearing

887
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,380
or anything like that?

888
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,323
- [K. Jones] It's in the video that I sent you.

889
00:35:42,858 --> 00:35:43,691
- [Braxton] Okay.

890
00:35:43,691 --> 00:35:44,524
So everything,

891
00:35:44,524 --> 00:35:46,080
pretty much what he looked like

892
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,010
and everything like that,

893
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,097
that's the same boy you're sayin you saw?

894
00:35:49,097 --> 00:35:50,599
- [K. Jones] Yes.
- [Braxton] Okay.

895
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:51,432
And you saw him two occasion,

896
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:52,740
and once on Thursday, Thursday.

897
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,641
- [Braxton] This past Thursday?
 - [K. Jones] Yes.

898
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:54,499
- [K. Jones] Yes.

899
00:35:54,524 --> 00:35:55,087
- [Braxton] And once today.

900
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:56,700
I'll ask this. When y'all first got there

901
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,990
and when y'all saw him,

902
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,130
what was his demeanor like?

903
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:01,230
- [K. Jones] He was already pacin

904
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,480
with his hand on his hip.

905
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,350
But I don't know why,

906
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,730
if it's just three females,

907
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,770
it's not like it was guys with the...

908
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,090
If it was a guy or something,

909
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:09,933
I see if-

910
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:11,880
- [Braxton] Right, right, right.

911
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,890
- [K. Jones] I see the
reason of him doing that,

912
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,997
but it was literally just three girls.

913
00:36:15,997 --> 00:36:17,717
- [Braxton] Well, you know,
some of these young people-

914
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,770
- [K. Jones] Well they're little and I'm like

915
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,750
a nice ass, I would say.

916
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,613
- [Braxton] Okay.

917
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,100
(detective chuckling)

918
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,363
Okay, if you say so!

919
00:36:28,543 --> 00:36:29,827
I don't argue with people.

920
00:36:29,827 --> 00:36:31,080
- [K. Jones] I'm sayin like,

921
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,610
body language and stuff, too.

922
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,690
Everything.

923
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,790
So if we would've been in our pockets

924
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,558
or I would've had my hand on the mig then,

925
00:36:38,558 --> 00:36:40,358
I would see him trying to retaliate.

926
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,690
- [Braxton] Kendall,
I never saw Kendall,

927
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,523
what is she?

928
00:36:45,364 --> 00:36:46,530
- She's like short, a
little shorter than me,

929
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,180
but she not built like me,

930
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,680
I used to box and stuff,

931
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,353
but she like a regular girl.

932
00:36:52,353 --> 00:36:53,993
She's a shrimpy girl.

933
00:36:53,993 --> 00:36:56,340
- [Braxton] Thin.

934
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,173
- [K. Jones] Medium.

935
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,350
- [Braxton] Medium, okay.

936
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,020
And your cousin? I haven't seen her.

937
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,716
- [K. Jones] She is small.

938
00:37:02,716 --> 00:37:03,750
- [Braxton] Okay, like?

939
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,300
- [K. Jones] She's short and she boney.

940
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,700
- [Braxton] Okay, got you.

941
00:37:09,385 --> 00:37:10,290
So you used to box?

942
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,123
- [K. Jones] Yeah, I did.

943
00:37:11,123 --> 00:37:11,956
- [Braxton] Okay, I got you.

944
00:37:11,956 --> 00:37:13,530
So you good with your hands, then?

945
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,923
- [K. Jones] Yeah, but I don't use my hands.

946
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,860
- [Braxton] I feel you,
there's nothing wrong with that.

947
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:23,280
Well, I'm sorry you had to go
through something like this.

948
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,113
- [K. Jones] Me too.

949
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,490
- [Braxton] We're working on all we can

950
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,710
trying to bring this to closure, okay?

951
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,060
So I'm gonna tell you what's gonna happen,

952
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,031
I'm gonna take you back out
here and sit you up front,

953
00:37:32,031 --> 00:37:33,360
and now I gotta talk to your cousin,

954
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,980
ask her some questions.

955
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,164
And then after I finish,
what's gonna happen then,

956
00:37:38,164 --> 00:37:40,320
I'm gonna talk to a couple
more detectives I work with,

957
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,260
and then we're gonna have
you taken back to your house.

958
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,093
Okay?

959
00:37:44,093 --> 00:37:45,750
- [K. Jones] We have to go back to my house,

960
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,683
My car is there.

961
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,350
- [Braxton] How'd, y'all
get over there, by your car?

962
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,600
What kind of car you got?

963
00:37:50,627 --> 00:37:52,348
- [K. Jones] A silver Honda.

964
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:53,908
Okay, what year?

965
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:57,875
- [K. Jones] 2000. The year I was born.

966
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,400
Okay.

967
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,440
So that's how y'all got over, by your car?

968
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,940
All three of ya?

969
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,650
And where'd you park your car at?

970
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,580
- [K. Jones] In front of her house.

971
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,870
- [Braxton] Right in
front of the building.

972
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,654
- [K. Jones] Like a little up.

973
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:09,487
- [Braxton] Okay.

974
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:12,900
- [K. Jones] It was a car in front.

975
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,980
- [Braxton] And Kendall
called, let her know, called-

976
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,073
- [K. Jones] Yeah, he said it was two here,

977
00:38:18,073 --> 00:38:19,863
that's why I'm thinking,

978
00:38:20,874 --> 00:38:23,670
like he got there moments
before we got there.

979
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,830
Or, you know what I'm sayin?

980
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,870
Because her demeanor changed.

981
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,670
At first it was cool
that when we got there,

982
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,503
it was like...

983
00:38:33,246 --> 00:38:35,850
It was confusing me.

984
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,020
- [Braxton] So when you
talked to her on the phone,

985
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,853
she was cool, everything was fine.

986
00:38:37,853 --> 00:38:39,575
- [K. Jones] Yeah, because Kenzo was like,

987
00:38:39,575 --> 00:38:40,740
we come in to get the rest of our stuff.

988
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,207
She was "All right, bet."

989
00:38:42,207 --> 00:38:43,740
be she was like, "Let me
know when y'all outside."

990
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,300
But we didn't think...

991
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,133
We didn't call like,

992
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:46,966
"Hey, we outside."

993
00:38:46,966 --> 00:38:47,799
We just knocked on the door.

994
00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:49,410
And she was like this,

995
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,850
but then the boy walk back,

996
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,980
and we put our foot right there.

997
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,360
I don't know if she's in danger,

998
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,543
'cause she always get in
domestic violence-like situation.

999
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,275
I don't know.

1000
00:39:00,275 --> 00:39:01,740
I don't know.

1001
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,790
- [Braxton] But y'all
let her know we know

1002
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,660
not here to 'cause any problems.

1003
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,980
- [K. Jones] Yeah, I told
her like plenty of times,

1004
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,840
we not here, we not on nothing.

1005
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,830
If we was on somethin

1006
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,300
I would've had...

1007
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,927
'Cause I seen him Thursday, I was like,

1008
00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:12,990
"Bro, can you come until one
of my brothers come with me

1009
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,950
or something.

1010
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,540
And then I know her kids being there,

1011
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,180
so like me, I'm a mom myself,

1012
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,470
I'm not problematic.

1013
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,428
- [Braxton] So you figured
with her kid being there,

1014
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:22,261
nothing like this-

1015
00:39:22,261 --> 00:39:23,610
- [K. Jones] Yeah, I'm
thinking he was like this,

1016
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:24,900
I'm seeing this little boy on the floor.

1017
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,450
I'm like he not gonna
do nothing, but he did.

1018
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,250
So it was just like,

1019
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,133
you don't even respect her
kid like that, it just.

1020
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,320
- [Braxton] So do you know her mother?

1021
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,270
- [K. Jones] I don't personally know her,

1022
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:43,050
but I ran into it with
her like a couple times.

1023
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,000
- [Braxton] Okay.

1024
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,300
And so you said the
only place you can think

1025
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,520
she would go if she left,
would be her mom's house?

1026
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,680
- [K. Jones] Yeah, but I'm not sure

1027
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,253
if she would go there, though.

1028
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:00,117
'Cause she got four kids,
so I'm trying to like...

1029
00:40:01,847 --> 00:40:04,196
I don't know 'cause...

1030
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:05,279
I don't know.

1031
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,693
- [Braxton] How old is your little one?

1032
00:40:08,718 --> 00:40:09,250
- [K. Jones] She's four.

1033
00:40:09,275 --> 00:40:10,617
- [Braxton] Oh,
okay. What's her name?

1034
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:12,711
- [K. Jones] Karter. With a K.

1035
00:40:22,723 --> 00:40:25,723
(detective exhales)

1036
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,560
How old was her child that was in there?

1037
00:40:30,585 --> 00:40:31,717
- [K. Jones] He's four, too.

1038
00:40:31,742 --> 00:40:32,521
- [Braxton] He's four, too?
- [K. Jones] Yeah.

1039
00:40:32,546 --> 00:40:34,677
- [Braxton] What's his name?

1040
00:40:34,702 --> 00:40:35,302
- [K. Jones] Zayden.

1041
00:40:35,327 --> 00:40:36,529
- [Braxton] Zayden?
- [K. Jones] Mhm.

1042
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,702
That's bad, something like
that happen for a little boy.

1043
00:40:41,702 --> 00:40:43,110
- [K. Jones] But this not, it's like,

1044
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,300
somethin happened a long
time ago, or something.

1045
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,620
She was telling me,

1046
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:50,433
but she didn't go into
detail and I don't know,

1047
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:53,734
I don't know.

1048
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:57,570
- [Braxton] Okay.

1049
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,419
Is there anything else you can think of

1050
00:40:59,419 --> 00:41:01,500
that you think of would
shed some light on this

1051
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,000
about what this might...

1052
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,560
Other than y'all coming
over to get clothes,

1053
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,393
you have no idea.

1054
00:41:05,393 --> 00:41:06,540
- [K. Jones] Honestly, that's what I'm sayin.

1055
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,430
She must have told him,

1056
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,080
I don't know what she told him about us

1057
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,710
'cause me and her, we were
the closest outta everybody.

1058
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,080
And we only got distance because,

1059
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,340
the boy she used to deal with,

1060
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,360
he came back in her life,

1061
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,400
but this is not the same guy,

1062
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,500
'cause I used to hang with him, as well,

1063
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,690
so I know what he looks exactly.

1064
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,830
I know his name and stuff,

1065
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,663
but that's not the same guy.

1066
00:41:26,663 --> 00:41:27,496
- [Braxton] What was that guy's name?

1067
00:41:27,496 --> 00:41:28,884
- [K. Jones] His name was Bishop.

1068
00:41:28,884 --> 00:41:29,717
- [Braxton] Okay.

1069
00:41:29,717 --> 00:41:30,780
- [K. Jones] Yeah, but that's not him.

1070
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,460
Cause he's a boney guy,

1071
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,080
he's real tall, that's not him.

1072
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,370
I know exactly what he looked like

1073
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,720
'cause I used to hang with him.

1074
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,280
But that's what I'm sayin,

1075
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,280
I don't know what...

1076
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,833
I don't know.

1077
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,940
- [Braxton] And you
say she had been a victim

1078
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,140
of domestic violence before?

1079
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:46,973
- [K. Jones] Yeah.

1080
00:41:49,827 --> 00:41:52,050
- [Braxton] And you
don't know if this is,

1081
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,370
other than what she had posted,

1082
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,080
it seemed like this is a new relationship

1083
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,370
she had been involved in.

1084
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:58,380
- [K. Jones] Yeah, 'cause
I never seen this boy,

1085
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,270
she never mentioned him or nothin.

1086
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,320
- [Braxton] Okay.

1087
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,020
When did y'all stop staying there?

1088
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,530
- [K. Jones] I would say a little time

1089
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,030
after her birthday.

1090
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,080
- [Braxton] And when's that?

1091
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,663
- [K. Jones] May, her birthday's May 16.

1092
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,410
- [Braxton] So do
you know about how long

1093
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,180
she'd been with this dude?

1094
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,470
- [K. Jones] No.

1095
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,210
- [Braxton] The picture
of your girlfriend

1096
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,530
sent you the video,

1097
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,453
what date is that on that video?

1098
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,760
- [K. Jones] She sent it July 2nd.

1099
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,710
- [Braxton] Okay.

1100
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,050
So between May

1101
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,563
and July 2nd,

1102
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,855
had y'all been talking during that time?

1103
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:11,700
- [K. Jones] Yeah, we were cool,

1104
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,440
regularly talking.

1105
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,753
But I wouldn't like hang with her no more.

1106
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,330
- [Braxton] What made y'all stop hangin?

1107
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,710
- [K. Jones] She started
dealing back with the guy

1108
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,592
I just told you about,

1109
00:43:21,592 --> 00:43:23,310
the abusive boyfriend the first time.

1110
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,549
And me and him got into it and stuff.

1111
00:43:25,549 --> 00:43:26,430
- [Braxton] That's the Bishop dude?

1112
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,410
- [K. Jones] Yeah, we had
got into it and stuff,

1113
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,150
but he never gave me...

1114
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,620
He would hit her again

1115
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:34,260
because he knew how
much we cared about it.

1116
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,510
So her and him broke up, or whatever,

1117
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:39,573
and after that she just
kept being distant.

1118
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,480
So that's the last time.

1119
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,765
- [Braxton] But you say,

1120
00:43:43,765 --> 00:43:45,455
you know this dude here is not the dude Bishop she was with.

1121
00:43:45,455 --> 00:43:46,869
- [K. Jones] That's not him at all.

1122
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:48,452
- [Braxton] Okay.

1123
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,600
But that's what made y'all stop

1124
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,830
chilling together, 'cause-

1125
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:53,663
- [K. Jones] She became,

1126
00:43:53,663 --> 00:43:54,600
no, not because of this,

1127
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,340
she became distant after they broke up.

1128
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,720
- [Braxton] After they broke up.

1129
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,030
Wow, that's messed up.

1130
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,890
- [K. Jones] But I'm thinkin, when that boy,

1131
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,030
I'm trying to piece it together.

1132
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,650
He said, "I just came home."

1133
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,960
I was thinking maybe when he came home

1134
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,340
they started dealing
back, so I don't know.

1135
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,503
It's just hard, I don't know.

1136
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,350
- [Braxton] So when that
dude say he just came home,

1137
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,540
you figured somebody she may
have messed with in the past

1138
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,770
or some dude she met.

1139
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:23,617
- [K. Jones] Mm hmm.

1140
00:44:26,983 --> 00:44:28,566
- [Braxton] Okay.

1141
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,890
About how old does that dude look?

1142
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:35,138
- [K. Jones] At least 24 through 26,

1143
00:44:35,138 --> 00:44:36,664
he was in his early twenties.

1144
00:44:36,664 --> 00:44:38,040
- [Braxton] In his early twenties?

1145
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,210
- [K. Jones] But looks can be deceiving

1146
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,703
'cause kids nowadays look older now.

1147
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:44,490
(detective chuckles)

1148
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:45,660
- [Braxton] Some of them.

1149
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,521
- [K. Jones] Yeah.

1150
00:44:46,521 --> 00:44:47,903
- [Braxton] Some of
'em look young still.

1151
00:44:50,335 --> 00:44:51,168
- [K. Jones] Like me.

1152
00:44:51,168 --> 00:44:52,484
- [K. Jones] Yeah, 'cause I really didn't think you were 21 at first.

1153
00:44:52,509 --> 00:44:53,844
I thought you were like, 16.

1154
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:56,163
So, okay.

1155
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,340
All right, well thank you
for being so straightforward,

1156
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,930
let me know what's going on.

1157
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:01,800
I'm gonna go out here,

1158
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,775
I'm gonna take time to
talk to your cousin.

1159
00:45:04,775 --> 00:45:06,016
Okay, you okay?

1160
00:45:06,016 --> 00:45:06,890
- [K. Jones] Yeah.

1161
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:08,246
- [Braxton] All right.

1162
00:45:08,246 --> 00:45:09,770
You think she gonna need them tissues?

1163
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:10,798
- [K. Jones] Yeah,

1164
00:45:10,798 --> 00:45:12,881
she'll probably cry, too.

1165
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:17,851
Thank you (indistinct).

1166
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:19,771
(door opens)

1167
00:45:19,771 --> 00:45:23,681
(detective's comments indistinct)

1168
00:45:23,681 --> 00:45:26,181
(door closes)

1169
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,059
(door closes)
